# Momotype
An experimental, retro take on tamagotchi-lite games. Will you satisfy Momo's needs, or does he need something greater?

He is cute.

## Why does this repository exist?
I forked the [original](https://github.com/JohnnyUrosevic/Momotype) repo because I wanted to make the game work on Android. And I did. But it cost my sanity.

## Downloading
You can simply grab the [universal APK](https://github.com/rojaoo/Momotype-android/releases/download/v2.1/momotype2.1-armeabi-universal-release.apk) from the [releases](https://github.com/rojaoo/Momotype-android/releases/) section, and it should work just fine.

## Building
So, you want to build it yourself? Start by downloading the [source code](https://github.com/rojaoo/Momotype-android/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) (or clone the repo, your choice), then get [Ren'Py 7.4.6](https://www.renpy.org/release/7.4.6) and Java 8.

Now, grab the folder that contains the [game](https://github.com/rojaoo/Momotype-android/tree/master/game) folder and drop it into Ren'Py's directory.

After that, open it, follow Ren'Py's instructions, and the program itself should take care of the rest for you.

# Disclaimer
I really hope getting the game files from Steam is not a problem. **If it is, please let me know**. The game is free, and you can check it [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1822190/Momotype/).

I only did this because the [original](https://github.com/JohnnyUrosevic/Momotype) source code was causing the game to crash with every version of Ren'Py I tested, even crashing with the built APK. So, I got the idea of getting the game files from the Steam's directory, and it worked just fine.

## To do
- [x] Build APK and release
- [x] Add APK icon
- [ ] Fix Play Protect pop up while installing
- [ ] Get rid of the "Ren'py loading..." screen
- [ ] PT-BR translation
