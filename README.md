# Momotype
An experimental, retro take on tamogotchi-lite games. Will you satisfy Momo's needs or does he need something greater?

## Why does this repository exist?
I forked the [original](https://github.com/JohnnyUrosevic/Momotype) repo because I wanted to make the game work on Android. And I did. But it cost my sanity.

## Downloading
You can just grab the [universal](https://github.com/rojaoo/Momotype-android/releases/download/v2.1/momotype-armeabi-universal-release.apk) apk from the [releases](https://github.com/rojaoo/Momotype-android/releases/) and it should work just fine.

## Building
So, you wanna build yourself? Well, start by downloading the [source code](https://github.com/rojaoo/Momotype-android/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) (or cloning the repo, you choose), then get [Ren'Py 7.4.6](https://www.renpy.org/release/7.4.6) and Java 8.

Now, grab the folder that contains the [game](https://github.com/rojaoo/Momotype-android/tree/master/game) folder and drop it into Ren'Py's directory.

After that, open it, do what Ren'Py says, and the program itself should do the rest for you.

# Disclaimer
I really hope getting the game files from Steam is not a problem, **if it is, please tell me**. The game is free, you can check it [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1822190/Momotype/). 

I only did this because the [original](https://github.com/JohnnyUrosevic/Momotype) source code was causing the game to crash with every version of Ren'Py I tested and even crashing with the built APK. So, I got the idea of getting the stuff from the Steam game files, and it worked just fine.

## To do
- [x] Build APK and release
- [ ] Add APK icon 
- [ ] PT-BR translation
