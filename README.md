# Momotype
An experimental, retro take on tamogotchi-lite games. Will you satisfy Momo's needs or does he need something greater? 

# Why does this repository exist?
I forked the original repo because I wanted to make the game work on android. And I did. But it cost my sanity.

# Downloading
WIP...

# Building
So, you wanna compile from the source? Well, start by downloading the [source code](https://github.com/rojaoo/Momotype-android/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) (or cloning the repo, you choose), then get [Ren'Py 7.4.6](https://www.renpy.org/release/7.4.6) and Java 8.

Now, grab the folder that contains the [game](https://github.com/rojaoo/Momotype-android/tree/master/game) folder and drop it on Ren'Py's directory.

After that, open it, do what Ren'Py says and the program itself should do the rest for you.
